“We are working to create a city that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change, like extended heat waves,” says Stacey, “and we can achieve this while creating green jobs and improving housing affordability.” Nearly 30 partners bring the Climate Challenge to life, many of them local and focused on ensuring climate action happens through a just transition approach. For instance, EVHybridNoire engages communities of color on vehicle electrification and Solar and Energy Loan Fund provides low, fixed-rate loans for home improvements, like energy efficiency upgrades. Most recently, Poder Latinx has stepped up to engage the community in strategies to improve the performance of existing building stock – a major opportunity to improve the lives of residents while decreasing utility bills and emissions.

Climate change presents local challenges stemming from a global problem. Orlando meets that challenge through partnerships at all levels: locally with OUC and energy partners, regionally as a member of the East Central Florida Regional Resilience Collaborative (ECFR2C), and internationally through membership in organizations such as ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability. More work needs to be done to address climate adaptation in Orlando and partnerships will be central to meeting this need. Starting In June 2021, the City began to develop its first Resilience Strategy, with a focus on equitable climate resilience. “We are working to create a city that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change - and we do this by keeping green jobs at the center.”

Flooding is becoming more prevalent with the extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global 
climate change (U.N., 2020). Florida is very susceptible to flooding but the increased contribution of 
climate change on flooding is concerning. There is a general increase of development regionally which 
increases risk and may exacerbate existing issues. Every new development must adequately address 
stormwater management but what used to be rare flooding events have been increasing in occurrence 
which makes it difficult to account for. It takes an incredible amount of resources to deal with all the 
externalities associated with flood mitigation and resiliency. FEMA flood maps have changed over time 
to better reflect the ever-changing environment. Now more existing and new housing is susceptible to

B. FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS - COMPLIANCE AUDITS
The City participates in a number of Federally assisted programs, primarily from the Environmental Protection 
Agency, Federal Transit Administration, Department of Justice, and Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. These programs are subject to audit and adjustments under the requirements of the Single Audit Act 
of 1984 and the Single Audit Amendments of 1996 for which a separate report is issued. The amount, if any, of 
disallowed claims (which could include revenue already received by the City) cannot be determined at this time, 
although the City expects such disallowed claims, if any, to be immaterial.
The City accounts for its polluting remediation obligations in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards

MA-65 Hazard Mitigation - 91.210(a)(5), 91.310(a)(3)
Describe the jurisdiction’s increased natural hazard risks associated with climate change.
According to the Florida Division of Emergency Management, typical natural hazards that impact Florida 
include drought, floods, wildfire, extremely cold weather, hurricanes, lightning, severe thunderstorms, 
heat waves, tornadoes, and marine hazards such as rip currents and waterspouts. According to the 
Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), climate change poses challenges exacerbating 
natural disasters, one major issue caused by climate change that will have a direct impact on the natural 
hazards seen in Florida is sea level rise. In addition to the impacts associated with sea-level rise, many of 
the hazards are likely to intensify and increase in frequency with the rising temperatures.
Knowing what to prepare for at a local level is critical in better insulating the City from the impending

Further exploration regarding the impact of climate migration due to both Orlando’s geographic location inland in Central Florida, as well as our ethnically-diverse population, is currently being conducted as part of the development of the City’s first-ever resilience plan.  SPOTLIGHT ON WELL-BEING:

Flooding is becoming more prevalent with the extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global 
climate change (U.N., 2020). Florida is very susceptible to flooding but the increased contribution of 
climate change on flooding is concerning. There is a general increase of development regionally which 
increases risk and may exacerbate existing issues. Every new development must adequately address 
stormwater management but what used to be rare flooding events have been increasing in occurrence 
which makes it difficult to account for. It takes an incredible amount of resources to deal with all the 
externalities associated with flood mitigation and resiliency. FEMA flood maps have changed over time

and recover from emergency situations. According to a Supplemental Research Bulletin by the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2017), Americans, in general, seem poorly 
prepared to deal with a natural disaster, but those of low socioeconomic status tend to be much less 
likely to prepare for an impending event. The correlation may be tied to the fact that mitigation and 
preparedness take direct financial contributions. For example, one of the major natural hazards 
impacting Orlando residents is hurricanes. The City’s Office of Emergency Management recommends 
getting seven days’ worth of non-perishable foods. Other recommendations include procuring plastic 
sheeting, storm shutters or using 5/8” plywood to fit over windows, installing straps or clips for roofs, 
etc. A cost-burdened family would have difficulty procuring this with limited disposable income.

“We needed to frame any collaboration in a way that we can grab hold of what the science says for our region and be able to step forward together,” says Rupert. Although the Collaborative officially kicked off in 2019, the Regional Planning Council has been working on the concept for years. As far back as 2005, the ECFRPC studied sea level rise and began to anticipate what the impact could be to local economies. Over the next 15 years, state funding became available for this type of work, mostly providing grants so that coastal communities could assess their vulnerability to increased flooding from hurricanes and sea level rise and the resulting impacts of those events.

projects is that change occurs most successfully if it is incremental and transparent. The level 
of change and intervention needed to transform Parramore and attract new public and private

Public-private partnerships should also be pursued. The ongoing Parramore Asset Stablization Fund, funded 
with $1,250,000 in funding, is helping to renovate 83 housing units on 44 properties, preserving affordable

Community Development’s Housing Rehabilitation Program may assist various households. A resident tool 
library and hands-on courses sponsored by non-profits and area businesses, as identified in the recent Mercy

In 2021, we find ourselves dealing with some of the most challenging issues in history — a global pandemic, civil and racial injustice, unprecedented economic hardship, and the existential threat of the climate crisis that is already causing billions of dollars in damage and the loss of thousands of lives every year.
Now more than ever, we have an opportunity to collaborate and work together to advance shared goals and priorities, starting in our own backyard. The SDGs offer us all the “Rosetta Stone” for a better world: this unifying framework guides our communities, states, and countries towards a more inclusive, green recovery from the pandemic, where everyone has the opportunity to realize their potential and the worst of future climate disasters are avoided.

For instance, EVHybridNoire engages communities of color on vehicle electrification and Solar and Energy Loan Fund provides low, fixed-rate loans for home improvements, like energy efficiency upgrades. Most recently, Poder Latinx has stepped up to engage the community in strategies to improve the performance of existing building stock – a major opportunity to improve the lives of residents while decreasing utility bills and emissions.

Following Hurricane Irma in Miami in September 2017, climate activist and community organizers created 
ad-hoc “community emergency operations centers” (C-EOCs). The Resilience Hub is the formalization of

Orlando has also been exploring various resilience strategies. The Resilience Plan would help pull all 
of these issues and strategies together into a more comprehensive plan.
Benefits: Equity and resilience were common themes during our future-ready stakeholder 
engagement meetings. Some examples that came up include:
• More than 50% of Orange County residents lost power due to Hurricane Irma a few years ago, 
with some losing power for more than a week. Not everyone can afford a back-up generator 
• Hurricane Michael had significant impacts on connectivity in Mexico Beach, FL.

Climate change presents local challenges stemming from a global problem. Orlando meets that challenge through partnerships at all levels: locally with OUC and energy partners, regionally as a member of the East Central Florida Regional Resilience Collaborative (ECFR2C), and internationally through membership in organizations such as ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability. More work needs to be done to address climate adaptation in Orlando and partnerships will be central to meeting this need. Starting In June 2021, the City began to develop its first Resilience Strategy, with a focus on equitable climate resilience. “We are working to create a city that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change - and we do this by keeping green jobs at the center.”

“We are working to create a city that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change, like extended heat waves,” says Stacey, “and we can achieve this while creating green jobs and improving housing affordability.” Nearly 30 partners bring the Climate Challenge to life, many of them local and focused on ensuring climate action happens through a just transition approach. For instance, EVHybridNoire engages communities of color on vehicle electrification and Solar and Energy Loan Fund provides low, fixed-rate loans for home improvements, like energy efficiency upgrades. Most recently, Poder Latinx has stepped up to engage the community in strategies to improve the performance of existing building stock – a major opportunity to improve the lives of residents while decreasing utility bills and emissions.

Climate change presents local challenges stemming from a global problem. Orlando meets that challenge through partnerships at all levels: locally with OUC and energy partners, regionally as a member of the East Central Florida Regional Resilience Collaborative (ECFR2C), and internationally through membership in organizations such as ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability. More work needs to be done to address climate adaptation in Orlando and partnerships will be central to meeting this need. Starting In June 2021, the City began to develop its first Resilience Strategy, with a focus on equitable climate resilience. “We are working to create a city that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change - and we do this by keeping green jobs at the center.”

In this moment of reflection, let us draw wisdom and inspiration from nature. The more biologically diverse an ecosystem is, the healthier and more resilient it is. A city is its own kind of ecosystem, and it’s critical that we create symbiotic pathways of collaboration among peer-governments, academic institutions, businesses, community and faith-based organizations, and most importantly, the residents that we serve. Goal 17 of the SDGs is a reminder that none of the prior 16 goals can be achieved in isolation. In that spirit, we look forward to continuing to work alongside our fellow city leaders to advance a healthier, more resilient, and more sustainable future for all.
