It also states that initial results from these meetings showed higher participation from residents within the downtown area and those who are comfortable riding a bicycle, indicating potential barriers to the participation of vulnerable populations. Additionally, the context mentions the need to ensure the full and fair participation of low-income and minority communities. The city has also identified the need to evaluate and mitigate the unintended consequences of improved mobility and access on low-income and minority communities. These actions indicate that the city has identified potential barriers and has taken corrective action to reduce these barriers.\n"
