      "The Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES) was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the spring of 2021. The purpose of this survey was to provide nationally representative data during a time when many students were attending school virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The online questionnaire was designed to collect information on health-related experiences and behaviors among high school students. These experiences and behaviors include COVID-19 related experiences, emotional well-being, experiences related to perceived racism, behaviors that contribute to violence and unintentional injuries, sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, alcohol and other drug use, tobacco use, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and inadequate physical activity. The ABES used a stratified, three-stage cluster sampling approach to obtain a nationally representative sample of public- and private-school students in grades 9â€“12 in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Participation in ABES was voluntary.\n"

The plan aims to address social inequities and environmental justice, particularly as they relate to struggles to access affordable housing, healthy food, quality education, quality healthcare, and economic opportunities. The plan also aims to ensure that all persons have the resources and support to bounce back in the face of adversity, and strategies will be evaluated to create a more equitable city. The development of the Resilience Plan includes steps to gain feedback on what resilience strategies should be prioritized, including those that support resiliency and equity.\n"
