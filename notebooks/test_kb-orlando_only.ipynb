To achieve this, the city has engaged with other governments, the business community, educational partners, utility providers, nonprofits, and residents to develop a future-ready roadmap. This roadmap will guide the city to continue advancing and embracing new opportunities to address community challenges. The city has also partnered with VHB and other local consultants to develop a future-ready city master plan. Input for this plan was gathered through various means including internal city stakeholder discussions, focus-area roundtables, public workshops, an online survey, and virtual workshops. The Future-Ready City Master Plan is a strategic plan that seeks to continue the city's path of innovation and co-creation with its diverse residents.\n"
